# Geoquiz


## ABOUT
This project is originally developed for a political science professor to use for her teaching at SPU and is supported by ETM (Educational Technogloy and Media). 

The project contains codes for quiz and front end for managing database. The live quiz is hosted in digital ocean and integrated to Canvas, however, users will need to configure those settings separately.
